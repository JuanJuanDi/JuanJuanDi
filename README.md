✖️ Hey, I’m Juan Diego ✖️

👁️   I love fullstack development because it lets me mix creatividad, cultura, and tecnologia to make cool digital experiences.
   
   I started coding to bring my artistic ideas to life through technology, connecting arte, moda, and musica with web development.
    
🎯 I’m just getting started on this journey, learning a bit more every day: from designing eye-catching interfaces to building       solid backends. 
   
   My goal is to get the hang of both frontend and backend so I can create awesome projects that blend my passions with the mundo digital.
    
🔗 I’m looking to team up on projects that mix tech with arte, where we can whip up web solutions for fresh and original ideas.
    
   I’m all about the challenges that bring together tecnologia, cultura, arte, and musica.

🖤  Random thought: I always have musica playing while I code.
   
   I feel like each line of code has its own beat, and I love finding that connection between the mundo digital and musica.
    
🚀 I’m super into interactive projects and want to explore making apps that bring artistic experiences to life.
    
   In the short term, I want to wrap up a personal project that shows how I see the world, and long-term, my dream is to help create a platform that sparks artistic explosion.
